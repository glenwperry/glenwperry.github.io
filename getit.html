				Quotation[114] = “Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.”–Aristotle";
				Quotation[115] = “If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters. Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing attitude.”–Charles R. Swindoll";

				Quotation[120] = “Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence.”--Hal Borland";
				Quotation[121] = “Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan ‘Press On’ has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.”–Calvin Coolidge";
				Quotation[122] = “An invincible determination can accomplish almost anything and in this lies the great distinction between great men and little men.”–Thomas Fuller";
				Quotation[123] = “The most dangerous leadership myth is that leaders are born — that there is a genetic factor to leadership.

				Quotation[125] = “Leadership is not magnetic personality — that can just as well be a glib tongue. It is not ‘making friends and influencing people’ — that is flattery. Leadership is lifting a person’s vision to high sights, the raising of a person’s performance to a higher standard, the building of a personality beyond its normal limitations.”–Peter F. Drucker";
				Quotation[126] = “The task of leadership is not to put greatness into people, but to elicit it, for the greatness is there already.”–John Buchan";
				Quotation[127] = “High sentiments always win in the end. The leaders who offer blood, toil, tears and sweat always get more out of their followers than those who offer safety and a good time. When it comes to the pinch, human beings are heroic.”--George Orwell";
				Quotation[128] = “Be patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it’s holy ground. There’s no greater investment.”–Stephen Covey";
				Quotation[129] = “Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.”–Norman Vincent Peale";
				Quotation[130] = “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.”–Winston Churchill";
				Quotation[131] = “Successful and unsuccessful people do not vary greatly in their abilities. They vary in their desires to reach their potential.”–John Maxwell";
				Quotation[132] = “Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It’s quite simple, really. Double your rate of failure. You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn’t at all. You can be discouraged by failure or you can learn from it, So go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because remember that’s where you will find success.”–– Thomas J. Watson ";
				Quotation[133] = “The great successful men of the world have used their imagination.  They think ahead and create their mental picture in all its details, filling in here, adding a little there, altering this a bit and that a bit, but steadily building – steadily building.”–Robert Collier ";
				Quotation[134] = “It is a paradoxical but profoundly true and important principle of life that the most likely way to reach a goal is to be aiming not at that goal itself but at some more ambitious goal beyond it.”–Arnold Toynbee";
				Quotation[135] = “Change your thoughts and you change your world.”–Norman Vincent Peale";
				Quotation[136] = “Your time is limited, don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other’s opinion drowned your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”–Steve Jobs";
				Quotation[137] = “Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.”–Maria Robinson";
				Quotation[138] = “Out of clutter, find Simplicity. From discord, find Harmony. In the middle of difficulty lies Opportunity.”–Albert Einstein";
				Quotation[139] = “Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose.”–Lyndon Johnson";
				Quotation[140] = “If we did all the things we are capable of, we would astound ourselves.”–Thomas Edison";
				Quotation[141] = “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”–Wayne Gretzky";
				Quotation[142] = “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”–Winston Churchill";
				Quotation[143] = “What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.”–Ralph Waldo Emerson";
