				<p><h3>My Best Work:</h3></p>

				<p>My best HTML/web content is hosted on Github Pages: <a href="http://glenwperry.github.io" >http://glenwperry.github.io</a>. It also includes professional writing samples.</p>

				<p><h3>What I’m Looking For:</h3></p>

				<p>The opportunity to  continue my career in a place where I can grow. Over time I'd like to increase my technical and leadership knowledge while contributing to creative content. I’m willing to start on a temp/contract basis and can start with as little as two weeks notice.</p>

				<p><h3>A Skill I’ve Learned:</h3></p>

				<p>I’ve been writing creatively as a hobby all my life and it’s something I’m always trying to get better at. My main interest is in literary fiction (Lorrie Moore, Updike) and I’ve put a lot of time into honing my skills in this area. I'm half-way through completing my first novel, titled "Bad Times." I'm also always working to increase my technical/professional skills; most recently by taking courses with EdX online in the subjects of Excel for Data Analysis and Visualization, Leadership and HTML5. .</p>

				<p><h3>What You’re Looking For:</h3></p>

				<p>An employer looking for someone who cares about achieving goals. Someone who will invest themselves in the product and make it a personal point to see that it succeeds. The most successful teams need to offer something that a larger or deeper-pocketed competitor might fumble. I have an exceptional track record as a team-player and beleive it is important for colleagues to inspire each other to meet their full potential.</p>

				<p><h3>How I’ve Invested In Myself:</h3></p>

				<p>I created this website showcasing my abilities specifically for the purpose of my current job search. I signed up for FreeCodeCamp (which I found on Github) and have already completed the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/jQuery curriculum (so far so good). I've taken online courses in Excel, Leadership and HTML5. I follow political and economic trends through the Library of Liberty and Economics as well as Democracy At Work. I also volunteer with Habitat Works, the L.A. Bike Coalition and 826LA.</p>

				<p><h3>What Drives Me:</h3></p>

				<p>My passion is to understand people, including myself. I do this through writing, through physical activity (backpacking, cycling), and by keeping a healthy desire to learn about anything and everything. I’m interested in all the secret human gunk that makes a life. I’m passionate about the aesthetic experiences, cultural tides and financial mechanisms that form our world on a personal and global scale.</p>

				<p><h3>If We Had a Band:</h3></p>

				<p>My role in the band would be pipe organist and we would play baroque horror punk. If I were to injure my fingers I would tell the rest of the band that they need to temporarily find another pipe organist but that I’m already teaching myself the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5qf9O6c20o&safe=active" target="_blank"> theremin</a> and that I’d still love to come to the gig up in New Brunswick.</p>

				<p><h3>Why These Questions:</h3></p>

				<p>I'm trying to give my future employer a feel for my personality across a broader spectrum than "where do you see yourself in ten years?" provides. I want to find a position in which I am a good fit, and which is a good fit for me, and I feel this is a better way of achieving it than providing a template cover letter using lots of Linkedin buzzwords.</p>
				<p>I have great professional references, and you can contact me at glenwperry@gmail.com or (818) 667-9798.</p>
