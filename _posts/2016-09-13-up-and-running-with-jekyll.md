Introduction
------------
I originally intended to write a detailed post about how I got Jekyll working on Windows 10. But I don't want to think about it right now. I'm working out the following issues and feel that I may be able to better explain the process in the future.

Still Working Out
-----------------

- ~~Proper syntax highlighting with Rouge~~
- Fix word wrap in syntax highlighting
- Get subtitle working in YAML
