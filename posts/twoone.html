                    <p>She’s too young for me. She’s not that young. Twenty-two year olds are real people. You were a real person at twenty-two. Right? You were wearing basketball shorts and jacking off a lot. You lived in a garage with a guy named Lars. You were depressed. Are you still? No, you’re better now. Stop overthinking this. She uses emoticons. All girls use emoticons. Hello Kitty’s fault? Stop worrying about being worried. ‘Fear is the mind killer, let it pass over you’ - Dune. Remember Dune. Breathe deeply ten times. Ten. Nine. Where am I supposed to take her? Eight. Someplace cool. An old bookstore full of dwarves and wizards. Seven. Maybe I can associate myself, in her mind, with wizards somehow. Six. She’ll never fall for it. Is she smart? She talks in a monotone like Daria. I think I love that. That doesn't mean she’s smart. Maybe she’s too insecure to use any vocal inflection. She talks low and steady while leveling those tranquil green starburst eyes at you. She makes you feel calm, remember? That long dark walk like a warm Xanax swim. Have you even been listening to her? You are too busy thinking about what clever thing you’ll say next. She uses the word ‘queer.’ Not sure how she means it. ‘There are a lot of queers there.’ She never received a liberal education. Does that mean she’s using it like ‘faggot’? I told her I loved her name. First, middle, last. All three are plant names. I told her she should be a Druid, with a name like that. She didn’t know what that was. I emailed her a picture of a Druid. Idiot, that’s second date stuff. I should not have told her about Druids. Fuck that, it doesn’t matter. She sends brief texts. Maybe she keeps her texts brief because she can’t write well. Maybe she just doesn’t want to talk. She uses lots of exclamation points. Yelling all the time. She abbreviates all her words. Maybe that deep lovely stare isn’t our souls intertwining. I’ve had a cow look into my eyes just as deeply. Does that make it untrue? Maybe that cow was falling in love. You can tip them over. I never would, I like them too much. She doesn’t really even drink. Good. Right? A real man doesn’t need a whole bottle to calm his nerves. You need four drinks to catch your stride, ten to ask someone to bed, fifteen to threaten to take them in the bathroom. Not sustainable. How did I get here? Blame Obama? No before all that. Twenty-two is old enough. Be a man. I’ve heard that. Do something that scares you every day. Is that something people say? Follow your dreams. People do say that, and it feels like it’s meant to make others feel bad. Don’t marry a drunk. Aunt Dolores is the one who says that. She’s only twenty-two but she doesn’t drink. Dance like no one’s watching. People say that, who are idiots. Dancing. Maybe I could take her dancing. She said her boyfriend helped move her up here. She visibly winced when she said it. She told me it wasn’t going to work out. It was dripping with intention. Was it? Maybe just sympathy. I don’t think she actually appreciates any of the parts about me worth appreciating. Not her fault. She doesn’t know. You are just richer and older than those queers at art school. I can dance okay. After I’ve had a few. Girls don’t care if you’re good at it, they just want someone there. You could learn how to dance better. Didn’t Doug Funny have Skeeter teach him just in time for the big dance? Classic TV trope. Maybe it was Richie Cunningham. She’s too young to even know who Doug Funny is. God she’s pretty. Sloe eyes, wet jewels. Black hair. Druid hair. That big smile that explodes out of her face; every feature is involved. A pouring out. Genuine. I have no idea about her body. She’s kept it hidden somehow, without me realizing it at the time. That face, that voice, that laugh. She’s put those out on the front line. That’s what is presented. You don’t know who she is. You have no idea. You fucking hypocrite. Be calm and learn. Stop thinking and breathe. Five. Grandma said breathing is the most important thing a person can do. Four. Three.</p>
