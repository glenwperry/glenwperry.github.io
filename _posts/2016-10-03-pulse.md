What is Pulse?
------------

https://pulsecounter122920161230081918.azurewebsites.net/

Pulse is a mobile application that lets businesses track how many people are entering and exiting their establishment. Register your business and create a unique organization key, share that key with your employees, and start tracking your popularity.

Employee-users keep a headcount with their mobile device and end-users can login and see what's good in the hood.

Use your stored Pulse data to gain new insight into your customers, track the effects of changes to your business and reach new demographics.
