                    <p>All  eyes  were  on  Oklahoma  City  this  proxy  season as  Chesapeake  Energy  shareholders  rumbled  into the  2012  annual  meeting  to  voice  their  discontent with  the  embattled  natural  gas  giant.  Perhaps  the most  contentious  meeting  of  the  season,  certain key elements were in place for a memorable media bonanza – a  lurking  Carl  Icahn, angry  shareholders,  government investigations,  and  a  CEO characterized  as  a  risk-addicted natural  gas  cowboy  pulling  the strings of a puppet board.</p>
					<p>Chesapeake  has  never  been  acorporate  governance  sweetheart;as  discussed  in  our  prior  ProxyPapers the Company has repeatedlyfailed  to  align  executive  pay  withperformance,  ignored  majoritysupported  shareholder  proposals,and  until  recently,  maintained  aclassified board structure subject toa plurality voting standard. however,it  was  following  two  Reutersarticles  investigating  the  tangledrelationship  between  the  Companyand  its  CEo,  aubrey  mcClendon,that  Chesapeake’s  governance  shortcomings  werefully thrust into the public eye. The articles detailedhow mr. mcClendon had used his personal stake inCompany wells as collateral to take out as much as $1.1 billion in personal  loans  frominstitutions  that  simultaneouslyprovided financing to the Company.The  articles  also  revealed  mr.mcClendon’s  prior  involvement  ina  $200  million  commodities  hedgefund which took positions in the samegoods produced by the Company.</p>
					<p>Following  the  Reuters  articlesthe  Company’s  credit  ratingwas  downgraded  by  both  S&Pand  moody’s,  which,  along  withcorporate  governance  concerns,cited  the  Company’s  cash  shortfallsas a reason for the downgrade – in2012  the  Company  took  out  a  $4billion  term  loan  in  order  to  coverdebt obligations. The Company hasannounced asset sales totaling $4.7billion  in  the  first  half  of  2012  andaims to raise an additional $8.3 billion from varioussales by the end of the year. In addition, the IRS andSEC  opened  investigations  into  mr.  mcClendon’spersonal  borrowings  and  certain  large  public pension funds initiated vote-no  campaigns  against  the Company’s directors.</p>
					<p>ahead of the annual meetingthe  Company  disclosedthat  mr.  mcClendon  wouldbe  stepping  down  aschairman of the board whileretaining  his  position  asCEo.  The  Company  alsodisclosed  that  it  would  bereducing  the  overall  levelof compensation paid to itsdirectors  and  eliminating  aperquisite providing for theirpersonal  use  of  corporateaircraft.  In  addition,  theCompany  agreed  to  putforth  a  managementproposal  providing  for  a  majority  vote  standard  indirector elections (a shareholder proposal requestingas much was originally approved at the Company’s2009  annual  meeting)  and  disclosed  that  it  wouldseek exemption from an oklahoma statute requiringa  classified  board  structure  for  public  companiesincorporated  in  that  state.  The  Company  helpedestablish the law in 2010 following majority approvedshareholder proposals seeking board declassificationat the 2008 and 2009 annual meetings. The Companyalso reached an agreementwith  its  two  largestshareholders, Southeasternasset management and CarlIcahn  (at  the  time,  ownersof  13.6%  and  7.6%  of  theCompany’s common stock,respectively) to reconstitutethe  board  by  replacingfour  current  directors  withthree  nominees  proposedby  Southeastern  and  oneproposed by mr. Icahn.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately for the board, their efforts proved to betoo little too late. approximately 424 million shares,or 66% of shares entitled to vote, were represented byproxy at the meeting (not including broker non-votes).both of the Company’s two director nominees weresoundly  rejected,  with  Richard  davidson  receivingabout  27%  of  the  votes  cast  and  v.  burns  hargis approximately  26%.  TheCompany’s  advisory  voteon  executive  compensationwas  rejected  with  only20%  support,  as  was  theCompany’s annual IncentivePlan  (which  permits  tax-deductions for performancebased  awards  granted  tonEos)  with  only  31.3%approval.  The  managementproposal  providing  for  amajority  vote  standard  wasalso approved.
					<p>Three of the four shareholderproposals  submitted  atthe  meeting  were  alsoapproved  by  shareholders:a request that the Companyre-incorporate to delaware, an elimination of certainsupermajority vote requirements, and a proxy accessproposal. Chesapeake is one of just two companieswhere  proxy  access  was  approved  by  shareholdersduring the 2012 proxy season (the other being nabors Industries). The non-binding proposal permits largeshareholders  to  nominate  board  candidates  on  the Company's ballot.</p>
					<p>In  June  the  Company  released  a  filing  announcingthat  the  board  had  accepted the resignation of mr.  davidson  while  rejecting  the  resignation  of  mr.hargis.  mr.  hargis  is  currently  the  audit  committeechairman  and  in  charge  of  leading  the  Company’sinternal investigation into mr. mcClendon’s personalborrowings. mr. hargis is also President of oklahomaState University, which received at least $2.0 millionin  commitments  and  donations  from  Chesapeake in 2011. The filing also stated that mr. hargis is notexpected  to  remain  chairmanof  the  audit  committee  andthat  upon  completion  of  theinvestigation  his  resignation  willbe  reconsidered.  Chesapeakehasn’t  said  when  the  board  willfinish the internal inquiry.</p>
