				<p><h3>My Best Work:</h3></p>

				<p>My best HTML/web content is hosted on Github Pages: <a href="http://glenwperry.github.io" >http://glenwperry.github.io</a>. It also includes professional writing samples.</p>

				<p><h3>What I’m Looking For:</h3></p>

				<p>The opportunity to  continue my career in the financial industry in a place where I can grow. Over time I'd like to increase my technical knowledge as well as gain experience contributing to creative marketing content. I’m willing to start on a temp/contract basis and can start with as little as one weeks notice.</p>

				<p><h3>A Skill I’ve Learned:</h3></p>

				<p>I’ve been writing creatively as a hobby all my life and it’s something I’m always trying to get better at. My main interest is in literary fiction (Lorrie Moore, Updike, Franzen) and I’ve put a lot of time into honing my skills in this area. The biggest challenge is stomping down all the nagging doubt and worry that I’m doing is ultimately pointless. In order to bat down that anxiety, I'm also always working to increase my technical/professional skills; most recently by taking courses with EdX online in the subjects of Excel for Data Analysis and Visualization, Leadership and HTML5. .</p>

				<p><h3>What You’re Looking For:</h3></p>

				<p>An employer looking for someone who cares about achieving goals. Someone who will invest themselves in the product and make it a personal point to see that it succeeds. The most successful teams need to offer something that a larger or deeper-pocketed competitor might fumble. I have an exceptional track record as a team-player and beleive it is important for colleagues to inspire each other to meet their full potential.</p>

				<p><h3>How I’ve Invested In Myself:</h3></p>

				<p>I created this website showcasing my abilities specifically for the purpose of my current job search. I signed up for FreeCodeCamp (which I found on Github) and have already completed the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/jQuery curriculum (so far so good). I've taken online courses in Excel, Leadership and HTML5. I've been reading up on the current economic environment (Capital in the 21st Century) and the future of business in the face of the current robotics and AI advancements (Data and Goliath, Rise of the Robots).</p>

				<p><h3>What Drives Me:</h3></p>

				<p>My passion is to understand people, including myself. I do this through writing, through physical activity (backpacking, cycling), and by keeping a healthy desire to learn about anything and everything. I basically want to be Benjamin Franklin. I’m interested in all the secret human gunk that makes a life. I’m passionate about the aesthetic experiences, cultural tides and financial mechanisms that form our world on a personal and global scale.</p>

				<p><h3>If We Had a Band:</h3></p>

				<p>My role in the band would be pipe organist and we would play baroque horror punk. If I were to injure my fingers I would tell the rest of the band that they need to temporarily find another pipe organist but that I’m already teaching myself the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5qf9O6c20o&safe=active" target="_blank"> theremin</a> and that I’d still love to come to the gig up in New Brunswick if Jimmy has room in the van.</p>

				<p><h3>Why These Questions:</h3></p>

				<p>I'm trying to give my future employer a feel for my personality across a broader spectrum than "where do you see yourself in ten years?" provides. I want to find a position in which I am a good fit, and which is a good fit for me, and I feel this is a better way of achieving it than providing a template cover letter using lots of Linkedin buzzwords.</p>
				<p>I have great professional references, and you can contact me at glenwperry@gmail.com or (818) 667-9798.</p>
