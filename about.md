About Me
--------
I'm a .NET web developer from Los Angeles.

What Am I Doing Right Now?
--------------------------
Winding down my role with [Retgrid](https://www.retgrid.azurewebsites.net), hashing out a plan for my geo-caching app, and trying to get 10,000 steps per day.

<!-- My Computing Timeline
----------------------------
1994 - In order to play [Banshee](http://gamesnostalgia.com/en/game/banshee) I'm forced to find the .exe using the the command line.

1996 - My cousin from Bakersfield lets me join his "hacking crew". We download all the progz we can find and mail-bomb each other all summer.

1998 - My friends and I learn about `view source` and `img-src`. We make lots of Angelfire sites about professional wrestling.

2001 - I drool over the [Soyo Dragon motherboard](http://techreport.com/review/3294/soyo-sy-k7v-dragon-plus-motherboard) for a year. I eventually get one and build my first computer.

2002 - I set up an Apache server and can send emails from any made-up address I want. I am too afraid to do this.

2003 - I get pretty good at Flash and make a game where you try to kidnap Russel Crowe.

2007 - In college I decide dual-booting Windows and Ubuntu on my Dell Inspiron will impress my roommate. My computer never works the same again.

2008 - I go to work for The Onion: A.V. Club. and for the first time get to do some professional front-end work.

2010 - I'm hired as a research analyst at Glass Lewis & Co. The company grows quickly and I assist the dev team fixing bugs and re-working HTML/CSS templates. I create the Research team portal using Bootstrap/Google APIs. I'm exposed to SQL and Python, which we use for executive compensation data analysis.

2016 - I leave Glass Lewis and begin working with retgrid.com using TFS, AngularJS, C#, SqlServer.

2017 - Retgrid development begins winding down. I'm ready to start a new challenge where I can be the best coder I can be. -->
