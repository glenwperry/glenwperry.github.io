Introduction
------------
Here's my first post on my new Jekyll built blog running on Windows. I originally intended to write a detailed post about how I got Jekyll working on Windows 10, but the truth is I barely understand how I did it. It was a lot of fumbling around and typing things I don't understand into the command prompt. I'm working out the following issues, though, and feel that I may be able to better explain the process in the future.

Still Working Out
-----------------

- Proper syntax highlighting with Rouge
- Markup syntax mastery ("~"~"strike-through"~"~"")
- Switching style-sheets for mobile/responsiveness
- ~~Getting a markup spell-checker in SublimeText~~
- Getting Auto-Regenerate to work
- Pushing changes from command prompt to Github pages
- Figuring out why markup changes to code colors for no apparent reason (escape commands?)
- Command prompt tricks to avoid pasting in long file locations
- SublimeText keyboard shortcuts, proper use of "projects"
- Fix word wrap in syntax highlighting
- Finish object methods prompt
- Finish alternating numbers prompt
- Get subtitle working in YAML

Already Worked Out
------------------ 

- Installing a linter and hinter for Javascript in SublimeText (install packages like ruby: preferences > packages)
- Customizing darcli Jekyll template (Realistically I could remove more assets, probably, and will try)
- Hit f6 to spell-check.
