                    <p>Wal-Mart’s  2012 meeting was a star-studded affair. Celine Dion and Taylor Swift performed, Bill Clinton had a pre-recorded video message, and host Justin Timberlake donned a hula skirt. As dazzling as the event may have been, a large number of shareholders had their minds elsewhere – specifically, Mexico – where allegations of widespread bribery at the Company’s largest foreign subsidiary have  sparked harsh criticism of the Arkansas-based mega-store.</p>
					<p>On  April 21, 2012, the New York Times (“NYT”) published an investigative report indicating that Wal-Mart de Mexico had distributed bribes in order to accelerate the Company’s expansion plans. According to the article, the Company launched an internal investigation in 2005 to follow up claims of widespread bribery, but quickly quashed the investigation upon discovery of suspect  payments totaling more than $24 million. The article further alleges that CEO Michael Duke and former CEO H. Lee Scott, among other directors and executives, were aware of the allegations and, in Mr. Scott's case, took steps to shut down a thorough independent investigation. The Company is currently the largest private employer in Mexico, with approximately 20%  of its more than 10,000 stores located in the country. If the allegations prove true, the Company’s actions could constitute a violation of federal securities laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices act (“FCPA”).</p>
					<p>Following publication of the article,the Department of Justice initiated a criminal probe into the allegations and a number of shareholder lawsuits were filed against certain of the Company’s directors and executives. A number of large public pension funds also  issued notices urging shareholders to vote against certain members of the board. Among those funds was the New York City Pension Funds (“NYC Funds”), which stated that in 2005 the NYC Comptroller and a group of institutional investors made several requests to the Company’s board to hire an independent firm to review its regulatory control. After a meeting with two members of the audit committee, including director Christopher Williams, their request for a review was rebuffed.</p>
					<p>Ahead of the meeting the Company disclosed that it was taking various measures to enhance its FCPA compliance measures, including the creation of a new global FCPA Compliance officer position. The Company’s audit committee, which is chaired by Mr. Williams, is also conducting an internal investigation into the allegations.</p>
					<p>The meeting saw approximately 16% of voting shares cast against former chief executive H. Lee Scott and roughly 13% of voting shares cast against CEO Michael Duke, chairman Robson Walton (son of founder Sam Walton) and audit chair Christopher Williams. Not counting the vote of company executives, directors, or members of the Walton family, that’s roughly 31%to 38% of voting shares cast against these directors. The Walton family retains control of nearly 50% of the Company’s outstanding shares, and as such, has significant control over all matters put to shareholder vote. </p>
					<p>While the collective effort of shareholders to remove these incumbent directors from the board was unsuccessful, we believe management and the board should take notice of this significant level of shareholder discontent and work to remedy the issues that raised  shareholder concern. In a June press release the Company disclosed that it had named KPMG International’s former chairman Timothy Flynn to its board and audit committee. In a separate press release, the Company disclosed that its expansion program in Mexico will be delayed two to three months due to added steps in its real-estate process. While there has been no news from the Company regarding the  progress of its internal investigation, we view the appointment of an independent director with international accounting acumen as a positive step in the Company’s review of its financial statements and FCPA compliance procedures. It remains to be seen whether the Company will face penalties for the alleged violations or whether similar problems involving the Company’s other foreign subsidiaries might manifest. While the five-year statute of limitations under the FCPa makes prosecution for the alleged bribes unlikely, the Company could still face penalties if it is found to have falsified its financial statements or conspired to obfuscate the findings of its initial 2005 investigation.</p>
