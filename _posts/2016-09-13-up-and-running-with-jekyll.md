Introduction
------------
I originally intended to write a detailed post about how I got Jekyll working on Windows 10. But I don't want to think about it right now. I'm working out the following issues and feel that I may be able to better explain the process in the future.

Still Working Out
-----------------

- ~~Proper syntax highlighting with Rouge~~
- ~~Markup syntax mastery~~
- Switching style-sheets for mobile/responsiveness
- ~~Getting a markup spell-checker in SublimeText~~
- ~~Getting Auto-Regenerate to work~~
- Pushing changes from command prompt to Github pages
- ~~Figuring out why markup changes to code colors for no apparent reason (escape commands?)~~
- Command prompt tricks to avoid pasting in long file locations
- SublimeText keyboard shortcuts, proper use of "projects"
- Fix word wrap in syntax highlighting
- Finish object methods prompt
- Finish alternating numbers prompt
- Get subtitle working in YAML
- ~~Installing a linter and hinter for Javascript in SublimeText (install packages like ruby: preferences > packages)~~
- ~~Hit f6 to spell-check.~~
