                    <p>Wal-Mart’s  2012  meeting  was  a  star-studded  affair.Celine dion and Taylor Swift performed, bill Clintonhad a pre-recorded video message, and host JustinTimberlake  donned  a  hula  skirt.  as  dazzling  as  theevent may have been, a large number of shareholdershad  their  minds  elsewhere  –  specifically,  mexico–  where  allegations  of  widespread  bribery  at  theCompany’s  largest  foreign  subsidiary  have  sparkedharsh criticism of the arkansas-based mega-store.</p>
					<p>On  april  21,  2012,  the  new  york  Times  (“nyT”)published an investigative report indicating that Wal-mart  de  mexico  had  distributed  bribes  to  officialsin  mexico  in  order  to  accelerate  the  Company’sexpansion plans in the country. according to the article,the  Company  launched  an  internal  investigation  in2005 to follow up claims of widespread bribery, butquickly quashed the investigation upon discovery ofsuspect  payments  totaling  more  than  $24  million.The  article  further  alleges  that  CEo  michael  dukeand former CEo h. lee Scott, among other direThe meeting saw approximately 16% of voting sharescast against former chief executive h. lee Scott androughly 13% of voting shares cast against CEo michaelduke, chairman Robson Walton (son of founder SamWalton)  and  audit  chair  Christopher  Williams.  notcounting the vote of company executives, directors,or members of the Walton family, that’s roughly 31%to 38% of voting shares cast against these directors.The  Walton  family  retains  control  of  nearly  50%  ofthe Company’s outstanding shares, and as such, hassignificant control over all matters put to shareholdervote.ctorsand executives, were aware of the allegations and, inmr. Scott’s case, took steps to shut down a thoroughindependent investigation. The Company is currentlythe  largest  private  employer  in  mexico,  withapproximately  20%  of  its  more  than  10,000  storeslocated in the country. If the allegations prove true,the Company’s actions could constitute a violation offederal securities laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices act (“FCPa”).</p>
					<p>Following  publication  of  thearticle, the department of Justiceinitiated  a  criminal  probe  intothe  allegations  and  a  number  ofshareholder  lawsuits  were  filedagainst certain of the Company’sdirectors  and  executives.  anumber  of  large  public  pensionfunds  also  issued  notices  urgingshareholders  to  vote  againstcertain  members  of  the  board.among those funds was the newyork  City  Pension  Funds  (“nyCFunds”),  which  stated  that  in2005  the  nyC  Comptroller  anda  group  of  institutional  investorsmade  several  requests  to  theCompany’s  board  to  hire  an  independent  firm  toreview its regulatory control. after a meeting with twomembers of the audit committee, including directorChristopher Williams, their request for a review wasrebuffed.</p>
					<p>ahead of the meeting the Company disclosed thatit was taking various measures to enhance its FCPacompliance  measures,  including  the  creation  of  anew global FCPa Compliance officer position. TheCompany’s audit committee, which is chaired by mr.Williams, is also conducting an internal investigationinto the allegations.</p>
					<p>The meeting saw approximately 16% of voting sharescast against former chief executive h. lee Scott androughly 13% of voting shares cast against CEo michaelduke, chairman Robson Walton (son of founder SamWalton)  and  audit  chair  Christopher  Williams.  notcounting the vote of company executives, directors,or members of the Walton family, that’s roughly 31%to 38% of voting shares cast against these directors.The  Walton  family  retains  control  of  nearly  50%  ofthe Company’s outstanding shares, and as such, hassignificant control over all matters put to shareholdervote.</p>
					<p>While  the  collective  effort  of  shareholders  toremove  these  incumbent  directors  from  the  boardwas unsuccessful, we believe management and theboard  should  take  notice  of  this  significant  levelof  shareholder  discontent  and  work  to  remedy  theissues  that  raised  shareholder  concern.  In  a  Junepress  release  the  Company  disclosed  that  it  had named  kPmg  International’sformer  chairman  Timothy  Flynnto its board and audit committee.In  a  separate  press  release,the  Company  disclosed  that  itsexpansion program in mexico willbe  delayed  two  to  three  monthsdue  to  added  steps  in  its  realestate  process.  While  there  hasbeen no news from the Companyregarding  the  progress  of  itsinternal investigation, we view theappointment  of  an  independentdirector  with  internationalaccounting acumen as a positivestep  in  the  Company’s  review  ofits financial statements and FCP acompliance procedures. It remainsto be seen whether the Company will face penaltiesfor the alleged violations or whether similar problemsinvolving  the  Company’s  other  foreign  subsidiariesmight  manifest.  While  the  five-year  statute  oflimitations under the FCPa makes prosecution for thealleged bribes unlikely, the Company could still facepenalties  if  it  is  found  to  have  falsified  its  financialstatements or conspired to obfuscate the findings ofits initial 2005 investigation.</p>
