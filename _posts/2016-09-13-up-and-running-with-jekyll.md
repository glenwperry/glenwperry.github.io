Introduction
------------
Here's my first post on my new Jekyll built blog running on Windows. I'm going to break down how I got this thing working because it took me several hours and wasn't nearly as "easy and simple" as everyone on the internet says it is. This is also my first time using markup! I'm excited to see how this turns out.

Things I might consume to celebrate:

- Potatoes
- Stuffed Grape Leaves
- Baby Back Ribs

Okay, so that unordered list didn't quite work out (got it working, needed a line break). Also, my auto-regeneration isn't working. There's an error, and then it says "no such file or directory - git rev-parse HEAD." Which doesn't make sense because - of course there's a file...I'm working in it <b>right now</b>. But everything else seems to be *basically working*. So that's a start.

Also, why isn't SublimeText highlighting my markup?

*One hour later* : Can't fix the auto-regeneration problem. Oh well, not essential. Everything else seems to bascially work.

It seems like lots of the resources for Ruby/Jekyll (including the people on StackOverflow in general) are purposely obscure. It's how nerds take the power back I suppose. I'm going to try to avoid that here.
