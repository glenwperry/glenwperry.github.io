                    <p><h3>All eyes were on Oklahoma City this proxy season</h3> as Chesapeake Energy shareholders rumbled into the annual meeting to voice their discontent with the embattled natural gas giant. Perhaps the most contentious meeting of the season, certain key elements were in place for a memorable media bonanza – a lurking Carl Icahn, angry shareholders, government investigations, and a CEO characterized as a risk-addicted natural gas cowboy pulling the strings of a puppet board.</p>
					<p>Chesapeake has never been a corporate governance sweetheart; as discussed in our prior Proxy Papers the Company has repeatedly failed to align executive pay with performance, ignored majority supported shareholder proposals, and until recently, maintained a classified board structure subject toe plurality voting standard. however, it was following two Reuters articles investigating the tangled relationship between the Company and its CEO, Aubrey McClendon, that Chesapeake’s governance shortcomings were fully thrust into the public eye. The articles detailed how Mr. McClendon had used his personal stake in Company wells as collateral to take out as much as $1.1 billion in personal loans from institutions that simultaneously provided financing to the Company. The articles also revealed Mr. McClendon’s prior involvement in a $200 million commodities hedge fund which took positions in the same goods produced by the Company.</p>
					<p>Following the Reuters articles the Company’s credit rating was downgraded by both S&P and Moody’s, which, along with corporate governance concerns, cited the Company’s cash shortfalls as a reason for the downgrade – in2012 the Company took out a $4billion term loan in order to cover debt obligations. The Company has announced asset sales totaling $4.7 billion in the first half of 2012 and aims to raise an additional $8.3 billion from various sales by the end of the year. In addition, the IRS and SEC opened investigations into Mr. McClendon’s personal borrowings and certain large public pension funds initiated vote-no campaigns against the Company’s directors. </p>
					<p>ahead of the annual meeting the Company disclosed that Mr. McClendon would be stepping down as chairman of the board while retaining his position as CEO. The Company also disclosed that it would be reducing the overall level of compensation paid to its directors and eliminating a perquisite providing for their personal use of corporate aircraft. In addition, the Company agreed to put forth a management proposal providing for a majority vote standard in director elections (a shareholder proposal requesting as much was originally approved at the Company’s2009 annual meeting) and disclosed that it would seek exemption from an Oklahoma statute requiring a classified board structure for public companies incorporated in that state. The Company helped establish the law in 2010 following majority approved shareholder proposals seeking board declassification at the 2008 and 2009 annual meetings. The Company also reached an agreement with its two largest shareholders, Southeastern asset management and Carl Icahn (at the time, owners of 13.6% and 7.6% of the Company’s common stock, respectively) to reconstitute the board by replacing four current directors with three nominees proposed by Southeastern and one proposed by Mr. Icahn.</p>
					<p>unfortunately for the board, their efforts proved to be too little too late. approximately 424 million shares, or 66% of shares entitled to vote, were represented by proxy at the meeting (not including broker non-votes).both of the Company’s two director nominees were soundly rejected, with Richard Davidson receiving about 27% of the votes cast and V. Burns Hargis approximately 26%. The Company’s advisory vote on executive compensation was rejected with only20% support, as was the Company’s annual incentive plan (which permits tax-deductions for performance based awards granted to NEOs) with only 31.3%approval. The management proposal providing for a majority vote standard was also approved.
					<p>Three of the four shareholder proposals submitted at the meeting were also approved by shareholders: a request that the Company re-incorporate to Delaware, an elimination of certain supermajority vote requirements, and a proxy access proposal. Chesapeake is one of just two companies where proxy access was approved by shareholders during the 2012 proxy season (the other being Nabors Industries). The non-binding proposal permits large shareholders to nominate board candidates on the Company's ballot. </p>
					<p>In June the Company released a filing announcing that the board had accepted the resignation of Mr. Davidson while rejecting the resignation of Mr. Hargis. Mr. Hargis is currently the audit committee chairman and in charge of leading the Company’s internal investigation into Mr. McClendon’s personal borrowings. Mr. Hargis is also President of Oklahoma State University, which received at least $2.0 million in commitments and donations from Chesapeake in 2011. The filing also stated that Mr. Hargis is not expected to remain chairman of the audit committee and that upon completion of the investigation his resignation will be reconsidered. Chesapeake hasn’t said when the board will finish the internal inquiry. </p>
