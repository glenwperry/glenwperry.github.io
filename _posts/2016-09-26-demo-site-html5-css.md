What I Made
------------
Here's a <http://glenwperry.github.io/club1984/index.html> demo website for a 80s theme dance night in Bellflower.

What I Learned
-----------------
- Pop up modal (still trying to get it to send form info to .asp) (**not possible with Github sites)
- Color gradients (review the three separate browser specifications)
- Big challenge in alignment. Seems stupidly difficult to align stuff with html5 - margins, top, left, inline-block, etc.
- Did a full protoype with Illustrator, which was just as tricky as making the actual site. Things changed in the coding process.

What I Still Need To Do
-----------------------

- Add thumbnail and popout modal for wireframes/prototype here
- Make input to .asp work
- SEO
