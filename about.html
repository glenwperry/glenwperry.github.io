				<p><h3>My Best Work:</h3></p>

				<p>My best HTML/web content is hosted on Github Pages: <a href="http://glenwperry.github.io" >http://glenwperry.github.io</a>. It also includes professional and creative writing samples. As for it's effectiveness? I created it after reading your job ad. So I’ll have to wait and see if you call me back. I personalized it from a preexisting bootstrap theme - but did all the work by hand in Notepad++.</p>

				<p><h3>What I’m Looking For:</h3></p>

				<p>The opportunity to gain professional experience with web content creation, copywriting and AdSense in a place where I can grow. Over time I'd like to increase my technical knowledge of web development as well as creative content creation. In terms of compensation, I'm seeking the *potential* for full-time employment at a rate no less than $30 per hour or $60k per year. I’m willing to start on a part-time basis as long as the chance for performance based wage/hour increases are provided over the next calendar year. I can start with as little as two weeks notice.</p>

				<p><h3>A Skill I’ve Learned:</h3></p>

				<p>I’ve been writing creatively as a hobby all my life and it’s something I’m always trying to get better at. My main interest is in literary fiction (Lorrie Moore, Updike, Franzen) and I’ve put a lot of time into honing my skills in this area. I’m currently 30,000 words into a full-length fictional novel that I’ve been working on for about one year. I’ve also attended night classes at UCLA extension to get myself involved in a community of likeminded writers. The biggest challenge is stomping down all the nagging doubt and worry that I’m wasting my time with this hobby when I could be learning something that might be more readily monetized. When working on a technically or emotionally challenging passage, rather than quitting, I have to look to the future and the end satisfaction of writing something that I feel is "true" - even if it's made up.</p>

				<p><h3>What You’re Looking For:</h3></p>

				<p>A small business is looking for someone who cares about achieving goals more than they care about punching the clock and telling their friends how “chill” their job is. Someone who will invest themselves in the product and make it a personal point to see that it succeeds. Someone who enjoys the earned sense of satisfaction that comes with true responsibility. A boutique business needs a team that works effectively together to offer something that a larger and deeper-pocketed competitor might fumble. Being small and nimble allows for flexibility and speed and permits skills and ideas that might otherwise by steamrolled or bureaucratically quagmired to shine through. In a more straightforward way, you're looking for someone with technical and creative chops who also has an interest in copywriting and AdWords.</p>

				<p><h3>How I’ve Invested In Myself:</h3></p>

				<p>I created a website showcasing my abilities specifically for the purpose of applying to this job. I signed up for FreeCodeCamp (which I found on Github) and have already completed the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/jQuery curriculum (so far so good). I've browsed some articles about effective PPC advertising. I already had some technical skills before, and have been building websites (including for my former employer) and creating things in various digital mediums since high school; but your job ad encouraged me to beef up my skill set. Whether or not we can enter into an employment relationship, I’ve already gained enough satisfaction through the learning process to make it all worth it.</p>

				<p><h3>What Drives Me:</h3></p>

				<p>My passion is to understand people, including myself. I do this through writing, through reading literary fiction, through physical activity (backpacking, cycling), and by keeping a healthy desire to learn about anything and everything. I basically want to be Benjamin Franklin. I’m interested in all the secret human gunk that makes a life. I’m passionate about the aesthetic experiences (film scores, smells, love letters etc.) that hit people right in the stomach and remind them that they’re far from alone on this planet. To (somewhat callously) bring it back to the job - I believe these same passions are mandatory requirements to creating compelling advertising that tells a story that people actually want to hear.</p>

				<p><h3>Our Band:</h3></p>

				<p>My role in the band is pipe organist and we play baroque horror punk. If I were to injure my fingers I would tell the rest of the band that they need to temporarily find another pipe organist because it’s essential to our vibe and  Halloween is when we pull the biggest crowd. I’d also tell the band that I’m already teaching myself the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5qf9O6c20o&safe=active" target="_blank"> theremin</a> and that I’d still love to come to the gig up in New Brunswick if Jimmy has room in the van.</p>

				<p><h3>Why These Questions:</h3></p>

				<p>I think you’re asking these questions to get a feel for my personality across a broader spectrum than "where do you see yourself in ten years?" provides. You want to see if my answers are boring or cheesy or self-involved. You want applicants who really *want* the position, so you’re making it more difficult than emailing a template cover letter full of Linkedin buzzwords. You're trying to see how my answers tie-in to the duties of the position and whether or not I'm capable of writing the kind of compelling content your clients need.</p>
				<p>I have great professional references, and you can contact me at glenwperry@gmail.com or (818) 667-9798.</p>
